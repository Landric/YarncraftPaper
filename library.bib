  abstract = {With the growing ubiquity of mobile devices, new ways of sensing context
	and the emergence of the mobile Web, digital storytelling is escaping
	the confines of the desktop and intertwinging in new and interesting
	ways with the phys- ical world. Mobile, location aware, narrative
	systems are being applied to a range of areas including tour guides,
	educational tools and interactive fiction. Despite this there is
	little understanding of how these applications are related or how
	they link with existing hypertext models and theory. We argue that
	location aware narrative systems tend to follow three patterns (canyons,
	deltas and plains) and that it is possible to represent all of these
	patterns in a conceptual sculptural hypertext model. Our model builds
	on a general sculptural mechansim (of pre-conditions and behaviours)
	to include locality and narrative transitions as first class elements,
	opening the possibility of standardised viewers, formats, and hybrid
	stories. We show how existing structures can be mapped onto this
	conceptual sculptural model, and how narratives defined in the model
	can take advantage of open data sources and sensed contextual data.
	To demonstrate this we present the GeoYarn system, a prototype which
	implements the model to create interactive, location aware narratives,
	using all three patterns.},
